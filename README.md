## Module 19: Unsupervised Learning

# CryptoClustering

In this module, I used my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to analyze whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. In this repository, you will find a folder named `CryptoClustering` containing a Jupyter notebook with code and analysis. There is also a `Resources` folder with the `crypto_market_data.csv` file used in the code.
